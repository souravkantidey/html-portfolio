<h3>Your Lie in April</h3>
<p>
  The main character, Kousei Arima (MC), is a talented pianist who loses his
  ability to hear the sound of the piano after his mother's death. He falls for
  a spirited violinist named Kaori Miyazono (FMC), who brings color and music
  back into his life. While Kousei believes Kaori is just a cheerful,
  free-spirited friend, she secretly harbors feelings for him. However, she
  doesn’t confess right away because she’s battling a terminal illness and knows
  her time is limited.

<h3>A Silent Voice</h3>
<p>
  A Silent Voice is about a guy named Shoya who used to bully a deaf girl,
  Shoko, when they were kids. Later, he feels bad about it and tries to
  apologize by reaching out to her. As they get to know each other again, they
  both deal with their own issues and learn about forgiveness, moving on, and
  understanding each other. It's a super emotional story about second chances
  and personal growth.

<h3>Akame Ga Kill!</h3>
<p>
  Akame ga Kill! follows Tatsumi, a young fighter who joins the rebel group
  Night Raid to overthrow a corrupt empire. As they battle powerful enemies
  using special weapons called Teigu, Tatsumi and his allies face heavy losses,
  with many characters dying throughout the series. In the end, Tatsumi
  sacrifices himself by using his Teigu to kill the emperor and bring down the
  empire, fulfilling his goal for a better world. Despite the victory, the cost
  is high—most of Night Raid is wiped out, and only Akame survives, reflecting
  on the harsh reality of war and sacrifice.
